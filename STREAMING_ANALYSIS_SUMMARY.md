- **Overall Efficiency**: Sharded is most resource-efficient

## 📈 **Strategic Recommendations**

### **For Maximum Throughput:**
- **Use Uniform Partitioning** for any node count
- **Optimal Range**: 1-8 nodes (diminishing returns beyond 8 nodes)

### **For Best Scaling:**
- **Use Dynamic Partitioning** when you need to scale beyond 4 nodes
- **Peak Performance**: 8 nodes (312.2 inf/s)
- **Trade-off**: Higher CPU usage but better scaling

### **For Resource Efficiency:**
- **Use Sharded Partitioning** for memory-constrained environments
- **Best Range**: 1-4 nodes
- **Avoid**: 16 nodes (significant performance degradation)

## 🔍 **Technical Insights**

### **Uniform Partitioning:**
- **Strengths**: Highest absolute throughput, consistent performance
- **Weaknesses**: Higher memory usage, limited scaling beyond 8 nodes
- **Best For**: Single-node to medium-scale deployments

### **Dynamic Partitioning:**
- **Strengths**: Excellent scaling, load balancing capabilities
- **Weaknesses**: High CPU usage, complexity overhead
- **Best For**: Large-scale deployments requiring load balancing

### **Sharded Partitioning:**
- **Strengths**: Resource efficiency, stable performance
- **Weaknesses**: Poor scaling at high node counts, performance degradation
- **Best For**: Memory-constrained environments, small to medium scale
